          As part of my Major Qualifying Project at WPI, I collaborated with a
          team to enhance an existing sleep and wellness tracking web
          application. We conducted a user study to identify pain points,
          redesigned the frontend UI for better usability, and improved backend
          functionality and error handling. I helped restructure the codebase to
          support long-term maintainability and future development. This project
          emphasized full-stack collaboration, user-centered design, and writing
          scalable, clean code.

          During a seven-week project in Panama City, I worked with Fundaci√≥n
          Ciudad del Saber to evaluate and improve a public park. I helped
          design and distribute community surveys, analyze both geographic and
          financial data, and co-develop a prioritized proposal for
          infrastructure improvements. We presented our findings to local
          stakeholders, combining data-driven recommendations with community
          feedback. This project sharpened my research, analysis, and
          cross-cultural communication skills.

          As part of a 10-person software engineering team, I helped build a
          hospital service management application. I developed a meal delivery
          system, an integrated search function, and contributed to an
          interactive map feature. I also collaborated on the main dashboard and
          ensured consistency in UI design across multiple features. This
          experience taught me how to work effectively within a larger agile
          team and deliver production-quality code.
