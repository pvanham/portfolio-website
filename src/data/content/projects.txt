My Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills in full-stack development, user research, data analysis, and collaborative problem-solving.

Z^3 Wellness Sleep App

Full-Stack Developer and Researcher
The Z³-Wellness application is a web-based platform designed for college students to monitor and improve their sleep and overall wellness patterns. This Major Qualifying Project involved continuing development from previous WPI teams, focusing on enhancing usability and functionality based on user feedback.

Key Contributions and Responsibilities
As part of a collaborative team, I played a key role in a comprehensive user study to identify usability issues, which directly informed the application's redesign.
Contributed significantly to a full backend overhaul, transitioning to a CRUD methodology with organized models, use cases, controllers, routers, and repositories for improved maintainability and scalability. This included adding historical data queries and optimizing frequently used queries with database views.
Actively involved in frontend development, including UI redesign, reformatting components using TypeScript, improving mobile responsiveness, and implementing a new navigation bar and customizable dashboard graphs.
Worked on critical bug fixes, updated outdated dependencies, and ensured consistent coding practices and documentation across the codebase.
Helped implement calendar integration (Outlook and Google) for stress level tracking associated with scheduled events.
Contributed to database schema improvements, including removing redundant ID fields and optimizing data entry processes with triggers.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Backend: Node.js (implied from server.js), Express (implied by CRUD structure for web app), Database: PostgreSQL, Authentication & Analytics: Firebase, Tools: Git, Qualtrics (for user study)

El Parque Redevelopment Project, Panama

Data Analyst and Community Researcher
This Global Projects Program initiative, in partnership with Fundación Ciudad del Saber (City of Knowledge) in Panama City, aimed to evaluate and recommend improvements for 'El Parque,' a significant public green space. The project focused on understanding visitor demographics, usage patterns, and community needs to inform the park's ongoing development plan.

Key Contributions and Responsibilities
Co-authored sections of the final report, including 'The Importance of Green Spaces' and methodology for 'Surveys'.
Authored the 'Suggested Improvements' section based on survey findings and the specific recommendation for 'Water Access'.
As part of the team, designed and distributed community surveys using various methods (fliers with QR codes, in-person intercepts, email lists via Typeform) to gather visitor feedback and demographic data.
Analyzed quantitative and qualitative data from 173 survey responses to identify key trends, popular services, and areas for improvement within the park.
Contributed to the development of four main prioritized recommendations for Ciudad del Saber: improving lighting, upgrading and adding bathrooms, increasing drinking water access, and enhancing communication with the park community.
Delivered a final proposal to local stakeholders outlining data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.

Skills Demonstrated
